Open all the tabs you need with just a click!

Well, 5 or 6 clicks anyways.
1. Download
2. Extract
3. Open the folder
4. Maybe open another one
5 and 6. Double click to run it!
So, it works like this. Basically, the program is already loaded with the automation, some standard times for an 8-hour school day(with 4-period block days), and messagaes that tell you what time it is or what hour you're in. You can change the start/end of each period by opening the file with a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.) and changing the values in the "time_is_between(start,end)" to choose your start and end of the class.

## You can also change the messages it prints.
Rather than saying "It's 4th Hour." your text could read "History test 4/17" or "Pretend this is an inspirational quote. -Some guy on the internet".
